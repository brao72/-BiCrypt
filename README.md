## About The Project

**Two-User Encryption** is a demonstration application that facilitates secure communication between two users using RSA-like cryptography. The application provides a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt messages seamlessly. This project is intended for educational purposes, illustrating the fundamentals of public-key cryptography and GUI development in Python.

## Features

- **RSA Key Generation:** Automatically generates RSA key pairs for two users, ensuring secure encryption and decryption.
- **Encryption & Decryption:** Users can encrypt messages to send securely and decrypt received messages with ease.
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Intuitive interface built with Tkinter, featuring input/output fields and actionable buttons.
- **Copy Functionality:** Easily copy encrypted messages to share between users without manual selection.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error messages guide users through correct usage and inform them of any issues.
- **Unit Testing:** Comprehensive tests ensure the reliability of cryptographic functions and conversions.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **Python 3.x:** The primary programming language used for developing the application.
- **Tkinter:** Python's standard GUI library used to create the graphical user interface.

### Backend

- **RSA Cryptography:** Implements RSA-like encryption and decryption mechanisms for secure communication.
- **Custom Utilities:** Includes functions for converting strings to numerical representations and vice versa.
- **Unit Testing:** Utilizes Python's `unittest` framework to validate the functionality of cryptographic components.
